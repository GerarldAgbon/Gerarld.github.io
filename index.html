        <p style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;color:black;font-variant: small-caps;font-size:large;">I am a part-time working student in Dahilayan Forest Park Resort for a year since 2021 until
        now in the present. I work as a food service crew, I also perform as a cashier, a barista and dishwasher. Although its hard to have it balance
        about work and academics, but still I am pursuing to finish my studies and have a part time job at the same time. I pursue IT because
        of my interests in computers and technologies. Since then, I am very curious in digital world, how do they work, what they are made of
        and how they are made. This curiousity made me believe that this path I'm taking now will help me develop different skills that I will
        apply soon in the future years.</p>
